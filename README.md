This is a project setup example that uses TypeScript and JSX
without npm, webpack, React or similar libraries.

Instead, this is using [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), a JavaScript bundler, transpiler
written in [Go](https://go.dev/). Esbuild supports TypeScript out of the box with no dependencies.

These days, the vanilla DOM manipulation API in JS is mature enough for
many simple projects.
